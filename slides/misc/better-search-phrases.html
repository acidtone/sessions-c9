            ## 90% of Web Dev is [Googling]

            ---

            ### Convergent vs Divergent Searching
            - **Convergent**: 
                - There is probably one answer to your problem
                - Example: finding a fat arrow syntax example
            - **Divergent**: 
                - There could be many answers to your problem
                - You're doing general research
                - Example: 
                    - finding alternatives to `for` loops
                    - finding inspiration for a logo design

            ---

            ### Convergent searching
            Effective search phrases are usually:
            1. **Concise**: Normally 1-4 words long
                - _Exception_: Copy/pasting an error
            2. **Domain-specific**: Terms that are used within a specific industry and not in general usage by "normies"
            3. **Qualified**: Qualifying terms further filter the results based on:
                - the skill level or the searcher
                - the specific goal of the searcher

            ---

            ## Domain-specific terminology
            1. Do a search for a single programming term:
                ```
                object
                ```
            2. Are the results relevant to web development? If not:
                - What other industries also use the term you've entered?
                - How can you make the term more domain-specific?
                
                    ```
                    js object
                    ```

            ---

            ## Activity: What's your jargon?
            In groups of 3 or 4, and taking turns:
            1. Share an obscure hobby/topic/profession/etc with the group;
            2. Ask others to list terms related to that domain;
            3. For the expert:
                - Are there more domain-specific terms that can replace the ones provided by your group members?
                - Based on the terms provided by the group, how would you rate the skill level of the person who provided it? Would you call them a "normie"?

            ---

            ## Qualifying terms
            A domain-specific term will still return many results that might not be focused enough to solve your problem:
            - Looking for tutorials?
                ```html
                node for beginners
                node getting started
                node examples
                ```
            - Use nerdy terms for nerdy results. Are the results different between these terms?
                ```html
                css docs
                css specs
                ```

            ---

            ## Example Searches
            How would you rate the following search phrases?
            - Were any words specific to the industry of web development? What are they?
            - How many words are used?
            - What is the skill level of the searcher? What problem might they be solving?
            - How would do you identify high quality results?

            ---

            ## "`How do I build a web site?`"

            ---

            ## "`Why isn't my CSS doing anything?`"

            ---

            ## "`web development`"

            ---

            ## "`html crash course`"

            ---

            ## "`js architecture patterns`"

            ---

            ## "`[your fave browser] devtools`"

            ---

            ## "`most underrated string methods`"

            ---

            ## Identifying high quality results
            Look for search results that:
            - Are current (does the resource have a date?);
            - Provide sample code;
            - Have video chapter markers;
            - Come from a trusted source;
                - **Pro-tip**: prepend your favourite content creator to find results from that person/site:
                    ```
                    mdn fat arrow
                    ```
            - Fit your learning style;
            - Are easy to find again. What search term would you use to find a favourite result in the future?

            ---

            ## Divergent searches
            ### with Suggestions

            ---

            ## Google (or whatever) Suggestions
            1. Enter a domain-specific term in your search bar but _DON'T_ hit enter:
                ```
                js loop
                ```
            2. Wait for Google to show completion suggestions
                ![Example of a Suggestion search](assets/images/searching/divergent-search.png)
            3. Pick a Suggestion to learn something new about that concept.

            ---

            ## "Verses" searches
            1. Add "vs" after a tool, concept, term:
                ```
                for loop vs
                ```
            2. Wait for Google to show completion suggestions
                ![Example of a verses search](assets/images/searching/verses-search.png)
            3. Is there a better alternative you should investigate?

            ---

            ### Activities: Divergent searching
            - Use Suggestions to find a new domain-specific term you didn't know before;
            - Try "verses" searches to find alternative to:
                - `curl` (or any other tool you use)
                - a programming method/concept you've learned in class
